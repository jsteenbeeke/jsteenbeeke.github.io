Hello there! If you're reading this then you're either a sentient web spider, or a human being looking for 
an **experienced software developer**. You may have found a link to this page on my
 [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeroen-steenbeeke-1b13676/), or I may have sent you here if you made the unfortunate decision
of sending me an e-mail.
 
In the past, this page housed a rather exhaustive list of things I was looking for in a perfect job 
and a bunch of other things, but seeing as you probably value you your time as much as I do mine, I've 
shortened it to just some basic instructions.

Some things you need to know:

 * I do not deal with agency recruiters
 * I am currently employed, and **not interested in leaving**
   * If I do leave, I am most likely to do so as a Freelancer
 * I work a 32 hour part-time job (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday), this is **non-negotiable**
 * I live in [Twente](/recruiters/twente), and am **neither willing to relocate nor comfortable commuting by car**
   * This also means emigration is a no-go
 * Even if I were interested in leaving, I would not consider:
   * Consultancy (or "Detachering")
   * Midlance companies
   * Companies that work on a project-by-project basis[^1]
 * I have no interest in using [older Java versions](/recruiters/modern-java-please)
 * I prefer technologies like Jakarta EE, Microprofile and Quarkus over Spring Boot
   
## Do's and don'ts

If you do decide to contact me, here's a small list of things you should and shouldn't do:

### Do

* Describe your application's technology stack in detail[^2]
* Give a salary range up front[^3]
* Be polite, I'll return the favor
* Include the keyword **sourdough** in any message you send me to confirm you have read this[^4]

### Don't

* Misbehave
* Insist I call you on the phone
* Deny that you're a recruiter
* Try to connect on LinkedIn, messaging is fine
* Try getting in touch with me through my current employer
* Send me e-mails
* Use any variation of the phrase "[let's have coffee](/recruiters/whats-your-deal-with-coffee)"
