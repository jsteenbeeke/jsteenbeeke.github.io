Hello there! If you're reading this then you're either a sentient web spider, or a human being looking for 
an **experienced software developer**. I might have even sent you here after you messaged
 [me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeroen-steenbeeke-1b13676/), or if you were [stupid enough to e-mail me](/recruiters/no-e-mail).
 
In the past, this page housed a rather exhaustive list of things I was looking for in a perfect job 
and a bunch of other things, but seeing as you probably value you your time as much as I do mine, I've 
shortened it to just some basic instructions.

Some things you need to know:

 * I do not deal with [agency recruiters](/recruiters/no-agency-recruiters), especially if they're [not based in the Netherlands](/recruiters/no-agency-recruiters#foreign-recruiters)
 * I am currently employed, and **not interested in leaving**
   * If I do leave, [I am most likely to do so as a Freelancer](/recruiters/about-freelancing)
 * I work a 32 hour part-time job (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday), this is **non-negotiable**
 * I live in [Twente](/recruiters/twente), and am **neither willing to relocate nor comfortable commuting by car**
   * This also means emigration is a no-go
 * I'm [not available for phone calls](/recruiters/fuck-phonecalls)
 * Read my list of [do's and don'ts](/recruiters/dos-donts) before you contact me. If you don't I'll likely just send you back here, or block you, and possibly your entire company.
