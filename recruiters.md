Hello there! If you're reading this then you're either a sentient web spider, or a human being looking for 
an **experienced software developer**. I might have even sent you here after you messaged
 [me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeroen-steenbeeke-1b13676/). 
 
Before we continue, a few words of warning:

 * I am currently employed, and probably not interested in leaving
 * I work part-time (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday), this is non-negotiable
 * **NO AGENCY RECRUITERS**
   * In a few exceptional cases I might agree to work with local ones (i.e. within 10KM of
  my home).
   * Sorry British and Spanish recruiters, unless you annex the Netherlands, this also means you.

Still reading? Good, here's a few things you need to keep in mind:

 * [What I am looking for](#what-I-am-looking-for)
 * [Do's and don'ts](#dos-and-donts)
 * [The recruiter blacklist](#recruiter-blacklist)
 * [The usual suspects](#the-usual-suspects)
 
# What I am looking for

I'm quite picky when it comes to companies I'm willing to work for, so here's a very elaborate checklist of things that
should apply to your company if you want me working for it.

## You are looking for a person who is going to write code

Project leads, testers, software analysts and business consultants all have their purpose within software organizations, but none of those positions appeal to me. My primary purpose in your organization should be the creation of software through writing code, otherwise I will not be a happy employee.

And no, I am not available (nor qualified) for a position as salesman or German teacher.

## The languages you work with appeal to me

The programming language I have the most experience with is **Java**, and I enjoy working with it, assuming we're talking about Java 8 or higher. I do not enjoy working on projects that are stuck on earlier versions (which, unless you're paying Oracle a hefty sum, are also unsupported).

I have experience working with Android, but I find the lack of Java 8 features (even with Retrolambda, StreamSupport and ThreeTen) to be too limiting for my enjoyment, so unless you're using **Kotlin**, I'll probably not be interested. 

**Swift** is another language I'd love to learn, as is **Scala**.

Working with **JavaScript** isn't a problem either (though I would prefer it not to be the primary language I work in), but a language such as **TypeScript** would be even better.

## The frameworks you work with appeal to me

Without enumerating all the frameworks I have experience with (have a look at either my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeroen-steenbeeke-1b13676/) or the [Showcase page](/Showcase) for an impression of that), there are a number I rather dislike, so if your core business is built around these then you're better off trying the next candidate:

 * Ember.js
 * JSF
 * JSP
 * Struts
 
In addition, I tend to get very cautious when your company uses Oracle software.

## You develop software in-house

Contracting (Dutch: detachering) does not appeal to me.

## Your job has a sensible overtime policy

As much as I like programming, I like seeing my family even more. I will refuse to work any form of structural overtime (i.e. so called "death marches" to meet a deadline). Incidental overtime usually isn't a problem, but I will expected to be compensated for it (in extra vacation hours, preferably).

Mandatory evening knowledge sharing sessions are a no-go for me, and if you're one of those employers who doesn't strictly require attendance but still lets the attendance record affect performance reviews then you're a dick and I don't want to work for you.

## I can work from home every now and then

As a rule, I work from the office, but every now and then a situation arises where it would be easier to
work from home for an afternoon or a day. If your company forbids this, then I won't work for you.

## Your contracts aren't filled with shit

I will refuse to sign contracts that try to take away my intellectual property rights outside of the scope of the job. I have several creative hobbies, and broad assignment of intellectual property rights to you causes a whole lot of shit for me.

## Your salaries are awesome

My current salary is pretty good, probably well beyond average for the region I live in, though not at all spectacular for the more populous regions of this country. If you're thinking of offering me a job, your salary should **beat** my current salary by a considerable margin.

### But you're already earning more than most people with your experience!

You should get out more if that's what you think.

### You can't earn that much without some serious negotiation skills

I've negotiated a higher salary than was initially offered exactly once in my career (a 3% difference).

### Giving you that much would be unfair to our other employees

That probably means you need to reevaluate your salaries; you're probably underpaying them.

### But our company's awesome!

That's great, but that won't lower my monthly expenses.

### But we have variable bonuses

Variable means "equal to zero when shit hits the fan".

For the sake of comparison with my current salary all your variable bonuses will be assigned a value of &euro; 0 (and for fairness I will also consider my current variable bonuses to be &euro; 0 as well, though that generally doesn't work in your favor as most of my salary is static).

### Okay okay, what number are we talking?

If I were working full time, my monthly salary would be somewhere between 1.5 and 1.75 times the Dutch modal income.

## The salary you offer me is not maxed out

Not only do I expect an awesome salary, I expect good performance to be rewarded by an increase in salary.

## Your company has good secondary benefits

I expect, as an absolute minimum, for your company to provide the following:

 * A good pension plan, with a sizable contribution of the fee by the employer
 * Paid travel expenses for my daily commute (or, if your company is **easily** reachable by train: a railway subscription)
 * At least 24 paid vacation days, preferably more

## Your company has a sensible approach to agile development

Agile software development does not mean "spend half the time you could have been programming in meetings to redefine our
 `definition of done`". Yes, I've really been through this, for almost a year, on a two-weekly basis. It's exhausting, 
 mind-numbing, and for some reason people were surprised our velocity kept dropping.
 
Oh, and if your answer to this is "we don't buy into this agile nonsense, waterfall forever!!", we're probably not going
 to get along.

## Your company has a sensible approach to security policies

Securing your infrastructure does not mean "developers cannot configure their own build servers". Not trusting your
developers is not a viable long-term strategy.

## Your company takes testing seriously

I expect your software to have a decent number of unit tests (the more the better), and I expect you to (roughly) know the
 test coverage of these tests (ideally with an idea of your mutation coverage).

I also expect you to have dedicated software testers on staff. I've worked with quite a few of them, and they prevent a
 lot of nastiness from creeping into your software.

## Your company takes application security seriously

If I have to explain what OWASP is on my first day you probably have bigger problems than not being able to find developers,
 and I will quit on the spot.

## Your company is located in central Twente

My current commute is roughly 35 minutes, by bicycle. I enjoy cycling to work, and I would like to continue to do that in my
 next job.

Enschede? No problem. Deventer? Did that for seven years, not sure if I want to do that again. Apeldoorn? Already too far.
 Amsterdam? Hell no. Nuremburg or Munich? LOL (you'd be surprised how often people contact me about jobs in southern Germany though).

## Your company's activities do not clash with my ethics

I will not work for companies:

 * That are active in the defense industry
 * That build surveillance software (and yes, "lawful interception" also counts as surveillance. Just because the law allows it does not mean it is justified)
 * That have anything to do with the tobacco industry
 
## Your company is clean
 
 A clean kitchen, clean toilets and clean rooms are a must.
 
## Your company uses good hardware
 
 What's more expensive? A good computer/laptop or your developers working at half speed?
 
## Your company allows me to use a good OS
 
 I really **really** hate Windows for development purposes. There are two things you can do:
 
  * Easy: Get me a Macbook Pro
  * Harder: Get me a Linux-compatible laptop (i.e. without Nvidia Optimus and hardware that speaks Linux) or workstation
  
## Your company isn't afraid to spend money on developer tools
 
 A good IDE (such as IntelliJ), good issue tracking software, a usable hour registration tool (in my experience, there are no good ones). If you
 want me to work for you, you need to make my life easy.
 
## Your company understands the need for quiet workspaces
 
 Developers need to concentrate. Putting us in a big room hurts our productivity. Putting the sales people in the same
 room destroys it.
 
 Four or five people in a single room is quite alright, though I'd love to work at a place that gave me a private office.
  
# Do's and don'ts

If you do decide to contact me, here's a small list of things you should and shouldn't do:

## Do

* Tell me the name of your company
* Describe your application's technology stack
* Briefly tell me what your company does
* Give a salary indication up front (a range is fine)
* Obey [Wheaton's Law](http://www.wheatonslaw.com/)

## Don't

* Insist I call you on the phone (I really don't have time to speak to every recruiter who stumbles upon my LinkedIn page)
* Send me contact invites on LinkedIn
* Try getting in touch with me through my current employer

# Recruiter blacklist

Did I mention I really hate recruiters? In addition to my **general ban on agency recruiters**, these people have pissed me
off enough to earn a special mention:

 * JouwJavaVacature (also JouwIctVacature and probably a dozen others)
 * uChoose
 * Bonque
 * StarApple
 
If you're not on the list, then congratulations, maybe you're not a total dick.

# The usual suspects

For some reason recruiters keep suggesting I go work at:

 1. Former or current employers - I know who to call if I want to work there again
 2. Companies where friends work - I'll let my friends do the introductions if I want to work there
 3. Companies that are well known in the region - if I wanted to work there I would have gotten in touch with them already
 4. Companies I've applied in the past, but decided not to work for - there's a reason I rejected their offer

I refer to these companies as "usual suspects", and any suggestions I go work there will be ignored:

 * Amis
 * Carthago ICT
 * Conclusion
 * Eijsink
 * Exxellence
 * Fortes
 * Group 2000
 * Impulse Info Systems
 * Innovalor
 * JDriven
 * Nedap
 * NerdsAndCompany
 * OV Software
 * PhoeniX Software
 * Sigmax
 * Sqills
 * TakeAway
 * Telecats
 * Thales
 * Topicus
 * Trimm
 * Vasco
 * Wehkamp
