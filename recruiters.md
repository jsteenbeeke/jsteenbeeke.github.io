Hello there! If you're reading this then you're either a sentient web spider, or a human being looking for 
an **experienced software developer**. I might have even sent you here after you messaged
 [me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeroen-steenbeeke-1b13676/). 
 
In the past, this page housed a rather exhaustive list of things I was looking for in a perfect job 
and a bunch of other things, but seeing as you probably value you your time as much as I do mine, I've 
shortened it to just some basic instructions.

Some things you need to know:

 * I am currently employed, and **not interested in leaving**
    * I'm not currently a freelancer, though [I am not ruling this out as a future career move](/recruiters/about-freelancing)
 * Even if I were interested in leaving, the current pandemic has reduced the chances of me leaving  my current job
   down from "highly unlikely" to "not a snowball's chance in hell".
 * I work a 32 hour part-time job (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday), this is **non-negotiable**
 * I live in Twente, and am **neither willing to relocate nor comfortable with a long commute by car**
 * I do not deal with [agency recruiters](/recruiters/no-agency-recruiters), especially if they're [not based in the Netherlands](/recruiters/no-agency-recruiters#foreign-recruiters)
 * I'm [not available for phone calls](/recruiters/fuck-phonecalls), and I'm **unlikely to meet with you unless you offer a [bribe](/recruiters/bribes)**
 * Read my list of [do's and don'ts](/recruiters/dos-donts) before you contact me. If you don't I'll likely just send you back here.
