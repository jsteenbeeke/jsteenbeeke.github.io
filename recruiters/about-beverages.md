People like to invite me over for a cup of coffee. However, I don't drink coffee, tea, hot chocolate
 or basically any beverage that is hot.

## How about a glass of water?

I have a functioning tap right here.

## Soda then?

I have a good supply right here.

## We also have beer?

During office hours?

### Sure!

I'm not much of a beer drinker. Single Malt Scotch is more my thing.

And no, you don't have to offer me Scotch.
 
## Dude, forget about the drink, we're just trying to be friendly because we want to talk to you

I am well aware of the social subtext of the phrase "let's have coffee", I'm being intentionally obtuse because
I have better things to do than talk to all ten million recruiters and HR persons who consider me a match for their
job opening.
