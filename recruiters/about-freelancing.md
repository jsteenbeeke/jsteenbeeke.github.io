I am not opposed to the idea of freelancing, and if I ever quit my current job, it is very likely my next step will be
to start as a freelancer. While this carries a significantly higher risk than regular employment, I am tempted by the
freedom freelancing offers, and as such, am not likely to respond favoribly to regular job offers.

If, however, your company:

 * Is located in Twente
 * Willing to work with freelancers
 
Then feel free to reach out to me!
