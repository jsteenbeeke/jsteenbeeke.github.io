Suppose you really want to talk to me about a potential job offer, you basically have two options:

1. [Buy me lunch in exchange for 20 minutes](#lunch)
2. [Buy me whisky in exchange for 90 minutes](#whisky)

## Lunch

I will happily talk to you about potential jobs, in exchange for a free lunch at the 
[Broodbode in Deventer](https://www.broodbode.nl/deventer-grote-overstraat/). This buys you up to
20 minutes of my time, though I expect you to be nice to the staff and tip them generously. I'm a regular
customer, so if you misbehave that reflects poorly on me.

## Whisky

Can't make your pitch in 20 minutes? In exchange for one of the following bottles of Scotch I'll happily
talk to you for up to 90 minutes:

* [BenRiach 25 year old](https://www.benriachdistillery.com/our-whiskies/aged-25-years/) (and **not** the Authenticus)
* [Tomatin 30 year old](http://www.tomatin.com/30year)

One caveat: you'll have to arrange a venue for us to talk, and it has to be within walking distance 
of Deventer's train station.

### That's pretty expensive

More expensive than an entry-level Scotch, maybe, but rather unimpressively priced on the grand scale. 

Last time I checked. The BenRiach is about &euro;200 and the Tomatin about &euro;300. It's not like
 I'm asking you to buy a bottle of Brora or Port Ellen (those start at around &euro;1700 last time I
  checked).
  
### How about <insert whisky bottle here>?
 
I won't say no if it's good whisky. Send me a message on LinkedIn to see how much time (if any) that buys you
