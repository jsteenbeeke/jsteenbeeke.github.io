Are you absolutely 100% convinced that the job you have is perfect for me, and that I absolutely must talk with you? 
1. You're probably delusional
2. If not, you can use the below checklist to see if you're correct

## The Checklist

I'm not interested in "we can match most of this". **None of this is negotiable**. 

If you answer **no** to **any** question you can stop right there and not bother contacting me.

1. The current date is before the 9th of May 2022 (after that you can consider this list outdated)

3. The company that wants to hire me is located in central Twente (i.e. I can walk or bike there), or wants me to work fully remote (forever)
4. The job title is cooler than "Senior Software Developer"
5. The company that wants to hire me is not a defense contractor
6. The company that wants to hire me is not a company that creates or supports any sort of surveillance technology

24. The contract includes a clause that exempts me from any standby duty for all of eternity
