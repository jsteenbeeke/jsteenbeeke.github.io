If you do decide to contact me, here's a small list of things you should and shouldn't do:

## Do

* Describe your application's technology stack
* [Give a salary indication up front](/recruiters/give-me-a-salary-indication)
* Obey [Wheaton's Law](http://www.wheatonslaw.com/)
* Include the keyword **sourdough** in any message you send me.

## Don't

* Be [arrogant, passive-aggressive or condescending](/recruiters/insert-insult-here)
* [Insist I call you on the phone](/recruiters/fuck-phonecalls), give me all relevant info up-front
* Bother contacting me if you're [not using a recent Java version](/recruiters/fuck-old-java-versions)
* Include [some bullshit rant about how you're not a recruiter](/recruiters/yes-you-are-a-recruiter)
* Send me contact invites on LinkedIn. I'll just press "Ignore" and click "I don't know this person"
* Try getting in touch with me through my current employer
* Contact me [by e-mail](/recruiters/no-e-mail)
* Invite me over for coffee. [I hate coffee](/recruiters/about-beverages)
