I get a lot of visits to my LinkedIn page, and plenty of people seem to be interested in offering me jobs. Yet for some reason
a lot of people want to talk to me on the phone.

First of all, I can read **much** faster than you can talk, so why on Earth would you want to convey information about a job vocally when
you probably already have it written down? Just send me the information.

Second, even if I were to speak to every interested party on the phone, I'd have no time left in the day.
