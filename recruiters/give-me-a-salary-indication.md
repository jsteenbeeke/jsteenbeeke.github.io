title: Give me a salary indication

I require a salary indication prior to any interviews taking place. This is to avoid spending hours on interviews only
to find out that a company can't afford me.
 
I expect the salary indication to be based on fulltime employment, and expressed as either a yearly or monthly salary. 
I'll also accept a range, but only if it's not too broad.

And yes, you can make an estimate without having interviewed me. My work history can be easily found on LinkedIn, and if
you can't get a decent picture of what I can do based on the numerous code samples on this site and on Github and Bitbucket,
then you have no business hiring developers in the first place.
