Do you value your time? I do! As such, for the very low number of jobs I might actually be
interested in, I have the following rule regarding job interviews:

* **No interviews until I get a salary indication**

Don't you just love it when you spend several hours going through interviews (or worse: spending a
week on an assessment), only to find out that:

* The company figures you'll accept a 10% lower salary than what you're currently earning
* Not only that, but the max salary at this company is already lower than your current salary

This [has happened to me](/2019/03/12/tales-from-the-interview.html#the-hurried-startup), and I'm
not going to waste my time on this again. So again:

* **No interviews until I get a salary indication**

In addition: 
* I want to know the extent of the salary scales. It's one thing to get an acceptable
  salary, but not if it means no further increases are forthcoming
* You only get one shot

## Common excuses

The following excuses will not be accepted:

### "We need to talk to you first to see what you're capable of"

It is a well-researched fact
that [job interviews are not suitable for assessing a candidate's capabilites (article in Dutch)](https://decorrespondent.nl/8700/de-slechtste-manier-om-een-goede-werknemer-te-vinden-een-sollicitatiegesprek/346155704400-8e4f5571)
, and no, you are not the exception.

So no, you do not need to talk to me to give me a salary indication. Go look at
my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeroen-steenbeeke-1b13676/),
[Github](https://github.com/jsteenbeeke), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/jsteenbeeke/)
and/or [Stackoverflow profile](https://stackoverflow.com/users/8819761/jeroen-steenbeeke), or, you know, [my tech blog](/) if you
need inspiration.

### "How much do you want?"

Have a look at my [checklist](/recruiters/checklist).

### "We don't like people who are overly focussed on salary"

Excellent, I'd love to have an emptier inbox. I'm sure there are hundreds of other potential candidates
you can go bother instead.

No? Well sucks to be you then.

### "Enjoying your job is much more important than getting paid well"

They're not mutually exclusive, I currently have a very enjoyable job with a nice salary. Not stellar,
 but it's a good trade-off between workload and compensation.

Besides, every single company who has ever told me I should focus on enjoyment rather than compensation
had, rather ironically, a really toxic work environment in addition to their low salaries.

### "How about you tell us your current salary so we can make a fitting offer?"

Sure, if you tell me the salaries of all your employees.

No? Then have a look at my [checklist](/recruiters/checklist).
