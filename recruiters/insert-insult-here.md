Every now and then a recruiter feels the need to vent their frustration on me. I understand, it's hard to do a meaningless
job every day and stay motivated, and I'd probably feel the same if I had a worthless college degree and was forced to
work in a boiler room.

I'd suggest working at McDonalds instead (honest hard work with tangible results), but I doubt you'd pass the hiring procedure.
