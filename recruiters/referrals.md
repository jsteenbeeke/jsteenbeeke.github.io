I will happily refer people in search of new jobs from my network. Assuming I am aware of any such persons (which is rare),
I charge &euro; 5000 per candidate, payable in advance.

## Payable in advance, are you nuts?

Oh, you thought I was going to do your job for you _for free_. That's adorable!

## What if I can't place the candidate you provided anywhere?

That's your problem, not mine. Maybe you're not a very good recruiter?
