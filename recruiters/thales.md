Roughly 70% of all agency recruiter messages I receive are for job openings at [Thales](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/countries/europe/netherlands). If I had a euro every time someone does, I could retire by now.

**In short: I am not currently interested in working at Thales.** This not meant in any disparaging way. I just don't feel Thales is a good fit for me as a person, and I'm happy with my current job.

If you have read this, and still send me a message to go work there anyway, **you owe me a bottle of Single Malt Scotch**

And here's a few tips:
- Don't try to obfuscate the company name when you approach people about jobs at Thales. There are only (by my last count) three companies in Hengelo that do stuff with Java, and only one that does stuff for the defense industry. It's really easy to figure out you're talking about Thales.
- I know at least four people who work at Thales (probably more if I actually take the time to check my LinkedIn connections). If I wanted someone to make introductions I'd call them.
