Twente is a region in the east of the Netherlands, located in the province of Overijssel, generally described as the region
between the rivers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regge_(river)">Regge</a> and [Dinkel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkel). 
The following towns and cities are close enough to where I live that I would consider a job there if I really wanted to leave my
current one (smaller towns near these I might also consider):

 * Almelo
 * Enschede
 * Hengelo
 * Oldenzaal

Twente is not the same as the Achterhoek, which is located farther south, in the province of Gelderland.
