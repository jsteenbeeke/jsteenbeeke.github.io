I sometimes receive enthusiastic messages (usually from in-house recruiters) suggesting I should come by their office
and "have some coffee". I'm of course familiar with the informal meaning of this phrase, but my developer brain can't help
but take this literally. The problem is:

**I really don't like coffee**

Or any hot beverages, really. I don't drink tea either, or hot chocolate. Drinks, for me, should be cold[^1]. I usually just
ask for a glass of water when offered a cup of coffee or tea somewhere.
