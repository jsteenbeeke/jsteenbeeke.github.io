The idea of working as a freelancer is appealing. Variation of assignments, freedom in choosing what
to work on, the potential for making quite a bit more money than I currently do. All of those seem quite
nice.

There are, however, quite a few downsides for me, personally:

1. **Hours**. I currently work 32 hours a week, which gives me more personal time, and more family time. If
  I were to freelance, then assuming I'd be able to find assignments where 32 hours a week is acceptable,
  and assuming I'd be able to spend at least 40 weeks a year doing actual work (including acquisition
  and administration), I'd only barely reach the hour criterium to be considered an entrepreneur and
  have the associated tax benefits.
2. My **Commute** is no longer time I can spend freely. Currently I travel to work (partially) by train, 
  and spend that time on hobbies. This is usually spent [writing fantasy books](https://www.jeroensteenbeeke.nl),
  a hobby which has suffered during times when I worked closer to home and didn't have a set writing
  time.
3. **Transportation** may also be an issue, depending on client locations. I'd either have to buy or
  lease a second car or ensure all my clients are either easily reachable by public transportation or
  be bike. 
4. **Finding clients** is something I don't know if I would be good at. A lot of freelancers (but not all)
  have a history of working for internment/detachering companies, and have larger networks than I have.
  Going through intermediaries might also be an option, but those aren't free.
5. Finally, freelancers are much more vulnerable to **economic downturn** or health issues. The market is
  good right, and I am quite healthy (and I know you can get disability insurance for freelancers), but
  I'm slightly risk-averse, so this is another barrier.
